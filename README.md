# SNAP-Project-Peg-Solitaire-Project

go to https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html and drop this file into it.

Outline: In this project, you will develop a Peg Solitaire game, which is a board game for one player involving movement
of pegs on a board with holes. The standard game fills the entire board with pegs except for the central hole. The objective
is, making valid moves, to empty the entire board (or leave as less peg as possible) except for a solitary peg in the central
hole.
